It's called DotTap and is available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.randomnessSlayer.dotTap) on the Google Play Store.\r\n\r\nThe premise is simple enough. Each game starts with two dots. Tapping a dot will cause the dot to disappear and will increment the score by one. Tapping the intersection between two dots \\(when possible\\) results in an additional point per extra dot tapped and spawns an extra dot. As the game progresses the dots shrink faster and faster. When all the dots are gone, the game is over and the high score is recorded.\r\n\r\n###More to Come Later\r\n___\r\n>Â©M. Dale 2016","google":"UA-73557121-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
